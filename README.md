tide: totte's integrated development environment
================================================

What is it?
-----------
A Vim-look-a-like with a select few IDE features for Python (as of now), put together using Python, C++ and Qt. It is written for the sake of fun and learning and may thus not be up to par with similar software in the same category. I'm imagining it'll be neither Vim or Eric, but rather something inbetween.

Planned features
----------------
* Graphic equivalent of the NERDTree Vim plugin
* Tab completion
* Go to file (think CMD-T or FuzzyFinder)
* Syntax highlighting using the same (if possible) syntax as Vim
* Vim modes: Normal, Insert, Visual etc.
* VCS integration (git, to start with)
* Split views, both horizontal and vertical
* No "invisible" buffers, all open files belong in a tab/view/whatchamacallit
* Diff (v-split) view
* Focus on keyboard navigation, not mouse
* Toggleable todo-list (to jump between "TODO" entries in the file)
* TextMate-ish snippets
